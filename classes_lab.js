// # Class Exercises

// (1 - 8 are the same as on the previous lab, but creating classes using ES6 syntax instead of constructor functions)

// ## Question 1

// a. Write a class called `Person` that has 3 properties: a first name, a last name and a middle name. Create 2 instances of a `Person`. Print one of their first names.
class Person {
    constructor(firstName, lastName, middleName){
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
        this.middleName = middleName;
    }

    fullName(){
        return  `${this.firstName} ${this.middleName} ${this.lastName}`;
    }

}
let person1 = new Person("kevin","wong","j");
let person2 = new Person("farrah","rios","isabelle");
console.log(person2.firstName);

// b. Write a method in `Person` called `fullName` that will return a formatted string of an instance's full name. Call this method on both the instances you created in part a.
console.log(person1.fullName());
console.log(person2.fullName());

// ## Question 2

// a. Create a class called `Book` that has properties `title`, `author` and `rating`. Create some instances of `Book`.
class Book {
    constructor (title, author, rating){
        Object.assign(this, {title, author, rating});
    }

    isGood(){
        if(this.rating >= 7){
          return true;
        } else {
          return false;
        }
    }
}
let book1 = new Book("Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind","Yuval Noah Harari", 9.2);
let book2 = new Book("Radical Candor: How to Get What You Want by Saying What You Mean","Kim Scott", 8.4);

// b. Add a method to `Book` called `isGood` that returns `true` if its rating is greater than or equal to 7
console.log(book1.isGood());
console.log(book2.isGood());

// ## Question 3

// a. Create a `Dog` class with four properties: `name (string), breed (string), mood (string), and hungry (boolean)`.

// b. Add a method called `playFetch`. It should set the dog's `hungry` property to `true`, set its mood property to `playful`, and log "Ruff!"

// c. Add a method called `feed`. If the dog is hungry, it should set `hungry` to `false` and print "Woof!" If the dog is not hungry, it should log "The dog doesn't look hungry"

// d. Add a method called `toString` that returns a description of the dog:

// ## Question 4

// There are three common scales that are used to measure temperature: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin:

// C = (F - 32) / 1.8
// F = 1.8 * C + 32
// K = C + 273

// a. Make an object called `freezingPoint` that has three properties: `celsius`, `fahrenheit`, and `kelvin`. Give them all values equal to the freezing point of water.


// b. Make a class called `Celsius` that has one property: `celsius`, and two methods `getFahrenheitTemp`, and `getKelvinTemp`.

// ```js
// let outsideTempt = new Celsius(10.0)
// outsideTempt.celsius //returns 10.0
// outsideTempt.getKelvinTemp() //returns 283.0
// outsideTempt.getFahrenheitTemp() //returns 50.0
// ```

// c. Give `Celsius` a method called `isBelowFreezing` that returns a `Bool` (true if the temperature is below freezing).

// ## Question 5

// a. Create a class called `Movie` that has properties for `name`, `year`, `genre`, `cast`, and `description`. Create an instance of your `Movie`

// b. Create an method inside `Movie` called `blurb` that returns a formatted string describing the movie.

// Ex: "Borat came out in 2006. It was an odd film starring Sacha Baron Cohen as a man named Borat who was visiting America from Kazakhstan."


// ## Question 6

// Write a class Vector that represents a vector in two-dimensional space.
// It takes two number arguments: `x` and `y` parameters, which it should be saved to properties of the same name.

// Give the Vector prototype two methods, `plus` and `minus`, that take another vector as an argument and
// returns a new vector that has the sum or difference of the two vectors’ (the one in `this` and the parameter) x and y values.

// Add a method `getLength` to the prototype that computes the length of the vector ;
// that is, the distance of the point (x, y) from the origin (0, 0).(a^2 + b^2 = c^2)

// [Vectors at mathisfun.com](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/vectors.html)

// ```js
// var v1 = new Vector(1, 2)
// var v2 = new Vector(2, 3)
// console.log(v1.plus(v2));
// // => Vector {x: 3, y: 5}
// console.log(v1.minus(v2));
// // => Vector {x: -1, y: -1}

// var v3 = new Vector(3, 4)
// console.log(v3.getLength());
// // => 5
// ```
// ## Question 7

// a. Write a class called `Cylinder` that has properties `radius` and `height`.  Create an instance of a Cylinder.

// b. Add an instance method `getVolume` that returns the [volume](https://www.mathopenref.com/cylindervolume.html)

// c. Add an instance method `getSurfaceArea` that returns the [surface area](https://www.mathopenref.com/cylinderareamain.html)

// ## Question 8

// [Dates in JavaScript](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-date-and-time-in-javascript#targetText=The%20Date%20object%20is%20a,the%20current%20date%20and%20time.)

// a. Write a class called `Post` that has properties `datePosted`, `user`, and `text`.  Create an array of `Post` objects.

// b. Create an instance method that returns whether or not the post was made today.

// c. Filter your array of `Post` objects to only include posts made today.

// ## Question 9

// a. Make a class called `Car` with properties `make` and `model`.  Create an instance of a `Car`

// b. Make a class called `Bike` with properties `gears` and `hasBell`.  Create an instance of `Bike`

// c. Give each class a static method called `numberOfWheels` that returns the number of wheels (2 for bikes, 4 for cars).  Why does it make sense for this to be a static method instead of an instance method?

// ## Question 10

// a. Make a class called `Vehicle` with properties `color` and `name`.  Give it a method called `makeSound` which logs "WHHOOSSSH" to the console

// b. Modify your `Car` and `Bike` classes from Question 7 to extend the `Vehicle` class.

// c. Create a new `Bike` instance that has a `color` of "green" and `name` "Bikey McBikeface"

// d. Create a new `Car` instance that has a `color` of "red" and `name` "Carry McCarface"
